# UNSW Gamified Learning Application Development

BFit is a mobile android application that displays daily health news, fitness workout courses, fitness plans, community ranking and profile information. 

## Disclaimer

The backend of this app utilises Glide Open Source Library to load images into the necessary ImageView holders. You may experience a slow image loading process based on your latency and Internet speeds.

**AGX Consulting is not liable for any app issues due to Internet connection errors.**

## Instructions
Pull the latest Github version and clean build and run the app on the latest version of Android Studio with minimum requirements of Android SDK Platform 30 Revision 3 (Android OS 11).

Once the app is running, login in using credentials or sign up for an account using the sign up button. Once logged in, you will be able to use the application. 

## Frequently Asked Questions & Common Issues

**1. The B-Fit app is not working, what can I do?**

The app has undergone rigorous testing before final build, therefore ensure you have the necessary plugins installed and meet the minimum system requirements by having the latest version of Android Studio with Android SDK Platform 30 Revision 3.

**2. Does B-Fit require a paid subscription?**

No, this app was designed freely and will not require any monetary value to access the app's functionality as it was designed to meet its stakeholder requirements.

**3. The YouTube videos are not working, what can I do?**

This error can be resolved by going to the previous screen with the list of workout courses and selecting the desired course again to display the YouTube video.

**4. The daily news section does not display images, what can I do?**

An API is used to retrieve this information and it is to be noted that not all news articles have an image added to them, therefore empty image placeholders are visible. At the current moment, a workaround has not been implemented. Apologies!
